          Natural Language Processing (NLP) is highly useful in many fields, as it has 
          many applications in the automation of repetitive tasks, summarizing, answering questions, enhanced searching, 
          content generation, and more!

                    <p> Tasks like costumer support, document handling, and data entry can be partially automated.
                        For example, NLP-powered chatbots can understand and respond to users very fast at any hour of the day

                        In data analysis, NLP gets insight from unstructured data like customer reviews and social media posts. It identifies 
                        patterns, trends, and emotions about particular people, places, etc. Businesses use this to better know how
                        their customers feel or what the public opinion is surrounding their product

                        <br>
                        Language translation converts text from a source language to a target language. NLP uses 
                        Nueral Machine Translation, encoder-decoder models, and deep learning to accurately conserve context, fluency, and nuance.
                        There are many challenges in expanding NLP translation to less common regional languages and in translating figurative
                        language like idioms and hyperboles
